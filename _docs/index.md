The PEP concept has two components: 

1. the standardized structure for organizing a project, which we call *PEP*
2. a toolkit with several pieces of software that are built around that standard

The first component is documented here in the section called *Creating a PEP*, which contains both simple examples and detailed documentation describing how to create a PEP-compatible project. This page is the primary source of documentation describing universal features of PEP structure, and the place to start if you're interested in using PEP structure to organize your projects.

The second component is outlined in the section called *Reading a PEP*. This page provides a brief introduction to each of the tools under development that can make use of your project. Each tool is its own separate project and has comprehensive documentation elsewhere, which you can find linked from the individual pages here. This will give you an overview of what is already available that can get you started analyzing your PEP or building a new PEP-compatible tool, but you should consult the detailed documentation for a particular tool for further information.
